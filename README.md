# AD-Homework

## Overview

This project demonstrates an algorithm to calculate the minimium amount of steps that needs to be taken to transform a string into another specified string.

## Files

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and autoamatically creates the randomly generated strings. The length of the strings can be modified by changing the values of the variables "m" and "n"
- `README.md`: Provides instructions for compiling and running the code.


## Compilation Instructions

To compile the code, you need a C compiler such as `gcc`. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
3. Run the following command to compile the code:
`gcc main.c -o ADHomework.exe`

This will generate an executable file named `ADHomework.exe`.

## Running the Program

After compiling the code, run the executable with the following command:
`ADHomework.exe`

## Code Quality

The code is well-organized into modules with clear interfaces. It follows good practices such as:
- Proper indentation and naming conventions.
- Comprehensive comments to explain the code.
